# Maze Solver

The idea for this came about when I watching a Computerphile video on
path-finding algorithms on YouTube. After watching it, I thought I'd
try to code up a naive approach to finding a path out of a given maze.
Currently you can choose from a few example mazes and see their
solution.

This is a pretty old project.

To Do:

- Choose the most optimal solution
- Allow user created mazes
- Animate maze solution

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
